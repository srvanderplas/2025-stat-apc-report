Apportionment problem: Partial-year data not included

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>This information seems to have been assembled from a source that does not take into account mid-year hires. Susan Vanderplas started at UNL in January 2020 and has a 20% Extension appointment, so for the 2019-2020 academic year, she would have been paid for between 5 and 6 months, depending on how 9-month contracts are handled. The Details tab of the metrics show a 0.0 percent extension FTE appointment for 2020, with subsequent years matching the 0.200 in the appointment.</p>

Headcount problem: Lack of Public Data Confirmation
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>There is relatively little clarity to be had about how apportionment was counted in these metrics. The only public data available to us is the <a href="https://nebraska.edu/offices-policies/business-finance/budget-and-planning">UN System Budget &amp; Salary Information</a>, which contains spreadsheets (“Budgeted Employees as of…”) and PDF documents (“University of Nebraska Salary Information”). Historical data is available.</p>
<p>The salary <strong>spreadsheets</strong> appear to show the cost distribution for a position (e.g.&nbsp;where the money comes from), but only when the position is more complicated than just having funding from multiple departments indicating a partial appointment, as shown in <a href="#fig-salary-sources" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. This happens most frequently when someone has administrative responsibilities in addition to standard research or teaching responsibilities.</p>

<p>It seems <em>likely</em> that the proportions in the FTE column (next from the last) of <a href="#fig-position-information" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> would represent the apportionment, but that doesn’t seem to always match what the individual understood their apportionment to be. When apportionments change, the university is supposed to provide written notice of the new contractual arrangement and it should be signed. In at least one case in Statistics, we could not find paperwork to match the effort allocation reported in the PDF FTE column. More importantly, however, it seems that the FTE column in the PDF doesn’t match the information assembled by the office of research and innovation to allocate research productivity to departments.</p>
<p>What this boils down to is that the Statistics department cannot get administration to explain why their numbers for people (and fractional people) in the department don’t match the administrations numbers. That is, we don’t even count department members the same way! Note that the individuals in question are longstanding members of the department who have e.g.&nbsp;taught Statistics courses, advised students, served on hiring committees - this issue spans most of the decade of research productivity metrics, and as a result, the impact cannot be assumed to be insignificant.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we could get data which matches our paperwork (if those columns exist in a database) and compare the different metrics, it would be possible to agree on a standard methodology for apportioning research productivity. These decisions happen in every data analysis, but we teach our students to (1) document the options which existed, (2) justify their selection of a particular option, and (3) conduct a sensitivity analysis after the analysis to see how much the results change based on the selection of a different way to measure a variable. The Office of Research and Innovation apparently did not do any of these things – and they also will not provide us with the data to validate their numbers ourselves.</p>

Instructor FTE Problem

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>This metric definition doesn’t make any sense. There is a single column of <code>appointment_apportionment_fte</code> for each unit.</p>
<p>If instead, this is intended to mean the sum of <code>appointment_apportionment_percent_teaching_fte</code> through <code>appointment_apportionment_percent_admin_fte</code>, it doesn’t make sense either, because those values should sum to <code>appointment_apportionment_fte</code> instead.</p>

Research Contributions by NTT Professors

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Our department had a long-time Professor of Practice, Kathy Hanford, who had a research and teaching apportionment and was the professor in charge of the SC3L. She retired at the end of 2023, so she <em>should</em> be included in most of our metrics, but isn’t because she was not tenure track. She does, however, count against our budget. Her research productivity, grant productivity, and collaborations across campus should count when evaluating the department’s importance within UNL, but they do not currently. The focus on tenure track positions to the exclusion of all others is incredibly damaging, particularly when a department is as small as we are. If Kathy had been hired more recently, the position would have likely been tenure track (and when the position was posted to find her replacement, it was posted as tenure track). The current head of SC3L, Dr.&nbsp;Reka Howard, is an associate professor in the department.</p>

Per-capita measures
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Different denominators are used to measure per-capita productivity in teaching and research across the analysis. In some cases, these are reasonable (e.g.&nbsp;it is reasonable to use total teaching FTE to calculate SCH per FTE values), but in others, these differences seem to arise primarily from the desire to conform to Academic Analytics or AAU metrics. While it is understandable that our administration wants to use metrics from other organizations rather than develop their own (this document exists because they don’t have the statistics training to design effective measures of variables of interest), this leads to significant and strange differences in productivity measures. It would be a far more coherent overall <strong>analysis</strong> if admin had used a single set of FTE measures consistently, rather than switching these measures up for different variables.</p>

<li>have 10 years of service as of their eligibility date</li>
</ul>

<p>Tracking this makes sense, but it’s unclear how this metric might factor into a final decision to combine or eliminate departments. Is it better to eliminate a department with a high percentage of VSIP eligible faculty, since the department might not be able to function after VSIP anyways? Or would it be better to eliminate a department without VSIP eligible faculty, since those savings won’t be double-counted by both VSIP and the elimination of the department, as the current analysis seems to do for the departments which will be combined (ALEC and Agricultural Economics, Entomology and Plant Pathology).</p>

Data Lockout and Validation
</div>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It is hard to validate the teaching metrics, because the administration has directed the registrar’s office and the graduate college “not to distribute data related to proposed budget reductions at this time” (<a href="documentation/Fw_%20Sarah%20Z%20-%20EDAD%20Data%20Request.eml">email between Sarah Zuckerman and Debra Hope, Graduate College</a>).</p>
<p>The Statistics department had similar trouble getting data from Chad Brasil, though most of it could be assembled (sometimes manually) using published Tableau dashboards. As a result, it is much harder to comment on or validate the teaching metrics. There are likely similar problems with the way variables were assembled, but because of the administrative lockout, we cannot do the necessary detective work to identify those problems.</p>

Completions to Majors for New Programs
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The statistics department has a new undergraduate program that, for AY 2024 (the last AY with statistics), had two cohorts of students. These students are included in the denominator as majors, but could not possibly have completed the program. As a result, of course, the department looks like we have a large dropout rate or are otherwise performing poorly.</p>
<p>It would be more reasonable to exclude new majors from this count until the program is mature and has all cohorts filled. In prior years, the statistics department has hovered around a 25% - 28% completion ratio, which reflects that our MS students take approximately 2 years to finish and our Ph.D.&nbsp;students take between 4 and 6 years to finish. We fully expect that our ratio will return to about that level when our undergraduate program is mature (if, of course, the university decides to keep this program), but it will likely decrease until that point, because we continued adding students who will take 4 years to graduate in AY 2025, and our first cohort is not expected to graduate until 2026.</p>

Graduation Rates Shouldn’t Be Pooled
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Most undergraduate programs take 4 years to complete. Most MS programs take 1-2 years to complete. Ph.D.&nbsp;programs vary considerably, but post-MS work might take between 2 to 4 years to complete, assuming the MS work transfers.</p>
<p>It is utterly confusing, then, to compute six-year graduation rates when the expected time to degree completion is so widely variable – six years is enough time for 5 different MS cohorts to complete their degrees, but only 2-3 undergraduate and Ph.D.&nbsp;cohorts! It’s also not uncommon for statistics students to get an MS and a PhD within 6 years - are those students counted twice?</p>
<p>Ultimately, graduation rates should be computed separately for each program, and if those are then averaged somehow that would be at least potentially sensible. But it is important to consider expected time to degree when computing graduation rates.</p>

SRI Problem 1 - Averaging Multiple SRI scores

<p>Some departments have multiple SRI scores generated by Academic Analytics.</p>

<p>Another reason a department might have multiple SRI scores is that it is composed of multiple different disciplines.

<p>When there are two different norms within a discipline, SRI scores were reportedly averaged to create a mean SRI value. This is incorrect - because these values have different distributions, averaging them does not produce a meaningful result with a valid comparison distribution. A more reasonable combination method would be to evaluate each score to get a distributional measure (quantile, percentile, rank), and then to take the maximum of that measure - the departments peers would know what the focus area of the department is and which focus would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>In the case of a hybrid department, the scores were also averaged. This approach is also not reasonable, as SRI distributions are not the same across disciplines. It is critically important to go through the distribution, calculating a rank, percentile, or quantile rather than using averages. Then, if the goal is to assess the department’s performance, two reasonable approaches could be used to aggregate the percentile or quantile scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a weighted average of the percentile or quantile scores, with weight determined by the composition of the department.</li>
<li>take the maximum of the percentile or quantile scores in order to assess the overall opinion of the work done within the department in a community of peers. This makes more sense if the goal is to model how other people see UNL’s departments, as people tend to remember outstanding work in the field more than they remember or consider average work.</li>

<p>Calculating a mean and standard deviation to create a z-score for SRI values across disciplines destroys any information which could have been found in the SRI measure.</p>
<p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an objection to SRI as a concept. It seems that SRI is a more fair method of comparison than other attempts to replicate SRI used in the budget reduction process, because at least all departments across a discipline are compared using the same (sometimes flawed) data<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. As it is, the metrics assembled by UNL, while applied to all departments equally, have unequal effects on different departments because the metrics used favor one discipline over another due to norms within that discipline. The problem with SRI is that it must be used in the context for which it was intended: comparing departments to other similar departments. The misuse of SRI results in eliminating programs which compare perfectly well to both Academic Analytics institutions and to AAU peers, as shown in <a href="#fig-sri-percentile-all-depts" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>.</p>
<p>While we do not have access to the complete data for all departments and their comparison units, we do have access to the statistics data, which is shown in <a href="#fig-sri-by-class" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>. The statistics department’s SRI value is at the top of the non-AAU R1 institutions, and is well within the bounds of the SRI range of AAU institutions. Note that we would not expect that a department be at the top of the AAU university SRI values (which is why the custom SRI score isn’t that useful, though the percentile is somewhat helpful) – what is necessary is for the department’s SRI to be above the minimum (preferably comfortably above) of the comparable AAU department SRI values.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong> Under the UNL proposed method (using the SRI relative to public AAU institutions), it seems that custom SRI is used instead of percentile. This renders any calculations done on SRI, and any calculations which use <code>sri_aau_public_peers</code> or <code>sri_aau_public_peers_z_score</code>, functionally meaningless as they are not comparing values drawn from the same distribution to each other. Without a common reference distribution, it is inappropriate to pool values by calculating a common mean and variance, and then to use that common mean and variance to produce a z-score.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> SRI should be converted to a percentile (or corresponding quantile, if the goal is a z-score), and in disciplines without sufficient comparison departments, there will be a lot of variability in the percentile (which should be treated as an estimate). SRI should be used to evaluate research productivity instead of attempting to create a multi-metric that adds additional weight to awards, books, citations, and grants x3, as Academic Analytics has already done the factor analysis to determine which of these are relevant to which disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>Theory &amp; Statistical Rationale</strong> The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem guarantees that as <span class="math inline">\(n\rightarrow\infty\)</span> the empirical CDF (eCDF) converges to the distribution CDF <a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ConvergenceOfTheEmpiricalDistributionFunctionOfASample/">demonstration via WolframAlpha</a>. While there is no guideline for sufficient <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the eCDF will be extremely blocky and step-function like at first, and as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases, the average distance between discontinuity points will decrease, producing an increasingly smooth function. The variance of the estimated percentile can be estimated by treating the percentile as a proportion and using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval">binomial confidence interval</a> to get a sense of the variability. Then, this binomial confidence interval can be mapped back to normal quantiles if a z-score range is desired.</p>

Book Disciplines and Book Data
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>While the book data from Academic Analytics is overall quite high quality, it does have some issues in that it is dependent on publisher reporting. The statistics department found at least one book which was misreported by the publisher, affecting the totals. More importantly, individuals do not have access to Academic Analytics – typically, only unit leads have access. Unit leads have neither the time nor the precise information to audit this information for correctness and follow up to ensure that it is fixed. These errors are likely more consequential for small departments, particularly in disciplines that are not book-centric as measured by Academic Analytics weights.</p>
<p>In addition, books are normalized by average tenure-track headcount without accounting for apportionment. Most (but not all) books published are research-centric, with textbooks as the exception. However, even textbooks are typically written while on research leave. As a result, it is probably more reasonable to normalize this value by average research FTEs rather than average tenure-track FTE.</p>

Citation normalization
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Normalizing citations by tenure-track headcount instead of by effective research FTE is problematic. Some departments have a significant number of non-TT faculty in research/extension positions who contribute to the scholarly literature in their field. In addition, some departments have a vastly different apportionment between research and teaching, and this would translate into different publication rates and accumulation of citations.</p>
<p>These factors are more critical when they are used to compare across departments within a university – when Academic Analytics makes comparisons using tenure-track headcount, that leaves out some information, but it would be expected to hurt similar departments similarly. This is not the case when using these metrics to compare across departments – in these situations, discipline specific norms must be accounted for in some way.</p>

Grant Metric Problems
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>All of the grant metrics are affected by a common flaw: disciplines do not (usually) compete against each other within a university for awards<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Rather, the English department might get awards from the National Endowment for the Arts or various private foundations. The Physics department likely gets grants primarily from NSF, and Engineering departments have some options - NSF, Dept of Energy, Department of Defense. Life sciences might get grants from NSF, but also NIH, CDC, Dept of Health, and the Veterans Administration. Agriculture grants will primarily come from USDA but may also come from NSF, NIH, and others because ultimately agriculture spans both applied and hard science topics across a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>What is important about this is that the amount of funding available (and size of available grants) is dramatically different between departments. That is, departments cannot be thought of as one single population! It is clear that someone putting these metrics together paid enough attention in a statistics class to remember how to compute a z-score, but apparently they missed the part where it makes no sense to compute z-scores when you don’t have a defined reference population. Or, in this case, when you absurdly claim that something that is clearly a mixture of several populations can be used as a single reference population.</p>
<p>Ignoring population heterogeneity (having multiple groups with different values in a population) is a common precursor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson’s paradox</a>, where a trend of the overall data reverses direction once the groups are accounted for in the model. Without the raw data for the individuals across the university, we cannot conclusively demonstrate that this is what is happening, but it seems possible. Alternate explanations are that the data quality is not particularly good (also possible). In any case, the research award metrics ultimately cannot be used for doing more than differentiating low-grant fields from high-grant fields.</p>
<p>In addition, smaller departments will have more variability in grant funding year-to-year than larger departments. When funding rates are low (10-20%), small departments may have $0 grant funding in one year and several awards come through in subsequent years, while large departments will have a more consistent funding level. While it is not clear how funding is counted on an annual basis (e.g.&nbsp;whether <code>research_awards_growth_inc_nuf_fy2020_total_research_awards</code> counts awards which started in 2020, were awarded in 2020, or incremental funding on multi-year awards that happened to be received by the university in 2020), if funding is counted at the award level and not the amount received per year, this measure gets to be even more “lumpy” and inconsistent from year to year. When taking a ratio of differences, as in <code>research_awards_growth_inc_nuf_percent_of_total</code>, this inconsistent behavior becomes even more problematic. It would be far better to fit a trend line with 4 or even 10 years of per-capita funding data to each department, and then do inference based on the slope of that line, generating a confidence interval or even a z-score for the slope of the line. Note that we do <em>not</em> recommend comparing departments based on that z-score, because the amount of funding available will be conditional on the department discipline, and picking winners and losers within UNL based on federal grant funding availability is short-sighted. Metrics are useful for description even when they are not used for inference.</p>

Problems with <code>research_awards_growth_inc_nuf_fy20_fy24</code>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Of all of the random variables created in this analysis, the most problematic from a statistical theory perspective might be <code>research_awards_growth_inc_nuf_fy20_fy24</code>. This is the ratio of two differences, where we might reasonably model each value in the numerator as a normal random variable with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_d\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_d\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> for department), and each value in the denominator as random variables with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_u\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_u\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> for university). The problem with this is that the two differences, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{d,2024} - \mu_{d,2020}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{u,2024} - \mu_{u,2020}\)</span> have mean zero, which leads to a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> situation that is mathematically undefined.</p>
<p>In statistical terms, if the numerator and denominator have mean 0, then the random variable representing the ratio is <strong>Cauchy</strong> distributed. Cauchy distributions are heavy-tailed (values far away from the mean are much more likely than they would be with a normal distribution), that is, they generate extreme values more frequency. Cauchy distributions are difficult to work with because they do not have a (meaningful) mean or a standard deviation. It is possible to generate draws from a Cauchy distribution, and even to take the mean and standard deviation of those draws, but the values do not describe anything useful about the underlying data. The mean will never converge to a single value, even with a million or billion samples, unlike nearly every other common distribution.</p>
<p>As a result, calculating the z-score for something that has or might be expected to have a Cauchy distribution is fundamentally problematic, because neither the mean or the standard deviation will have any real-world meaning or even be numerically stable. The Central Limit Theorem requires that variables have finite variance precisely because of the counterexample of the Cauchy distribution.</p>
<p>Cauchy random variables are typically not covered in undergraduate math-stat and probability courses, except perhaps a mention in passing. That they arise so readily in this type of analysis is just another example why it is fundamentally necessary to have graduate statistical training or oversight in order to use complex functions of random variables to make practical decisions that will hold up under scrutiny.</p>

Instructional Z-score Problem
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>While standardizing scores is common practice in some circumstances, it is problematic as used here, in part because it assumes that there is a single common distribution used for these values. For instance, disciplines that only have graduate programs cannot be assumed to have the same distribution of SCH because of much lower numbers of graduate students. It is utterly ridiculous to compare these programs to programs such as math or english who teach large numbers of nonmajor undergraduate service courses and will have SCH values on a vastly different scale. Departments <strong>do not</strong> have quantities which can be said to be “identically distributed” (in statistical parlance) even if you assume that the instructional metrics are reflective of a distribution of department performance, because not every department is competing in every pool. At minimum, it would be necessary to do some assessment of whether a course is primarily taken by majors or nonmajors, and then compare service teaching load separately from major teaching load, and undergraduate hours separately from graduate hours. Even under this system, it is probably necessary to “bin” departments based on the number of service courses taught/required on an annual basis, because e.g.&nbsp;Math will teach Calc 1, 2, 3, but Chemistry might teach an elective introductory course that counts for a science prerequisite, and the structural differences between these two departments and their relationship to other majors offered on campus matter significantly. While these factors are related to department productivity, no amount of work by the EDAD department is going to ensure that they teach every undergraduate STEM major an introductory service course, and as such it is ridiculous to compare SCH between EDAD and MATH or PHYS or STAT.</p>
<p>Moreover, the description of interpretation implies that these are normally distributed variables, but e.g.&nbsp;share of growth is necessarily confined to a value between 0 and 1, which is decidedly not normal because the normal distribution has support over the entire real line (that is, every value between <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> has a positive, theoretically non-zero probability, though of course the values far from the mean of the distribution are expected to be infinitesimal).</p>
<p>When a metric consists of a ratio of two values, as many of these metrics do, it is even less likely that the random quantity has a normal distribution. In fact, if the numerator and denominator both have mean zero, the ratio is Cauchy distributed, and Cauchy variables do not have estimable means or variance – you can calculate a value for observed data, but it does not mean anything or converge to anything and is not an estimator of any useful quantity. While the problem is not quite as dramatic when the means of both distributions are nonzero, it is still important to be cautious because there are a number of different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_distribution">ratio distributions</a> which might be relevant and not all of them are “nice”. This might be expected to be the case with a variable like <code>budget_to_sch_2024</code>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, just because you <em>can</em> calculate a z-value doesn’t ensure that it has meaning in the context of the data. Even if it would <em>seem</em> to have meaning, and every point is taken from the same reference distribution, if the values are ratios, it would probably be good to check with a statistician before proceeding, because it is <em>very</em> easy to end up in a nonsensical mathematical situation.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Academic Analytics analysts are very aware of the flaws in their data. If UNL wants to improve as an institution, one way to facilitate that would be to have PIs to ask e.g.&nbsp;federal grant agencies other than NIH and NSF to report data to Academic Analytics, as this would likely help us. Another option is for UNL to actually talk to analysts at Academic Analytics and to ensure that UNL follows statistical validation procedures that are as well thought out as AcA’s procedures.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The Fulbright program might be one common exception, as it allows applications from many different disciplines. However, this would likely fall under “Awards” more generally instead of research awards/grants.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
