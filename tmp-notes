Meeting focus

- Need to go through percentiles for SRI
  - SRI isn't comparable
  - Limits of percentiles -- comparison group not big enough for eCDF amp

- Variability on department measures based on small departments

- Career stage and young-ness of the department

- p1_expenditures
682590.663 for stats

The average (over what?) competitively funded (how is this determined?) federal
research support as defined by the AAU membership policy,
federal research expenditures less USDA research expenditures
adding in awards from USDA Agriculture Food and Research Initiative (AFRI).

Expenditures and AFRI awards are credited to departments using NuRamp routing forms.
For PI/co-PIs who routed their credit through a unit outside a department, efforts were
made to credit a department using the individualâ€™s HR tenure org unit, primary org unit and
any secondary appointments.


- what is competitive
- average over what?
-

citations - 77 vs 127

articles aren't counted but books are



- sch
  - 2020 numbers seem off by a factor of 10, but doesn't seem to affect downstream metrics???

- retention rate
  - lots of churn between stats and data science by design -- lower retention rates doesn't mean this is malfunctioning

- avg retention rate
  - 5 cohorts don't exist for SDAN so nullified

- grad_rate6
  - graduation rate doesn't seem to have been nullified even though we couldn't have had graduates. Not sure what the 9% graduation rate comes from???

- research_average
  - this average is entirely nonsensical and shouldn't be used

- research_avg_z_score_equally_weighted
  - also badly composed and shouldn't be used

- sri_aau_public_peers_z_score
  - this has so many problems I don't know where to start
  - for one, SRI shouldn't be used directly because different distributions AND because comparing apples and oranges
  - for another, SRI shouldn't be transformed into a z-score because that's nonsense

- awards_budget_inc_nuf_z_score
  - z-score of total_sponsored_awards_inc_nuf_rsch_pub_serv_teach_avg_awards_budget
  - This is another poorly created z-score, because z-scores assume a common distribution that doesn't exist when comparing departments to departments outside of the discipline/practice. University-wide normalization here is just going to make large-grant disciplines look really good compared to everyone else.
