::: callout

Our department had a long-time Professor of Practice, Kathy Hanford, who had a research and teaching apportionment and was the professor in charge of the SC3L. She retired at the end of 2023, so she *should* be included in most of our metrics, but isn't because she was not tenure track. 
She does, however, count against our budget. 
Her research productivity, grant productivity, and collaborations across campus should count when evaluating the department's importance within UNL, but they do not currently. 
The focus on tenure track positions to the exclusion of all others is incredibly damaging, particularly when a department is as small as we are. 
If Kathy had been hired more recently, the position would have likely been tenure track (and when the position was posted to find her replacement, it was posted as tenure track). 
The current head of SC3L, Dr. Reka Howard, is an associate professor in the department.

### SRI Problem 1 - Averaging Multiple SRI scores

Some departments have multiple SRI scores generated by Academic Analytics. 

In some disciplines, departments might be book-focused or article focused, or might have members with different focuses. 
Examples in @fig-sri-multiple-values include Communication Studies, Sociology, Advertising, Landscape Architecture, Interior Design, and Broadcasting, among others. 

Another reason a department might have multiple SRI scores is that it is composed of multiple different disciplines. 
Examples in @fig-sri-multiple-values include Agronomy & Horticulture, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, the School of Computing, Physics and Astronomy, and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

```{r message = FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width = 9}
#| fig-cap: Some Units at UNL have multiple SRI values, either because different departments focus on books or articles within the discipline, or because departments have faculty from multiple disciplines. 
#| label: fig-sri-multi-values

unl_depts |> 
  mutate(short_name = reorder(factor(short_name), `SRI Percentile`, median)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = `SRI Percentile`, y = short_name)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, aes(colour = Focus), alpha = 0.75) + 
  annotate("point", x = filter(unl_depts, short_name=="Statistics")$`SRI Percentile`, y = "Statistics", color = "black", shape = 1, size=4) + 
           theme_bw() + 
  ylab("") + 
  ggtitle("Units at UNL, ranked by their standing compared to all AcA - monitored peers") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#d00000", "steelblue", "grey70")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title.position = "plot")

```

When there are two different norms within a discipline, SRI scores were reportedly averaged to create a mean SRI value. 
This is incorrect - because these values have different distributions, averaging them does not produce a meaningful result with a valid comparison distribution. 
A more reasonable combination method would be to evaluate each score to get a distributional measure (quantile, percentile, rank), and then to take the maximum  of that measure - the departments peers would know what the focus area of the department is and which focus would be more appropriate. 

In the case of a hybrid department, the scores were also averaged. 
This approach is also not reasonable, as SRI distributions are not the same across disciplines. 
It is critically important to go through the distribution, calculating a rank, percentile, or quantile rather than using averages. 
Then, if the goal is to assess the department's performance, two reasonable approaches could be used to aggregate the percentile or quantile scores:

- take a weighted average of the percentile or quantile scores, with weight determined by the composition of the department. 
- take the maximum of the percentile or quantile scores in order to assess the overall opinion of the work done within the department in a community of peers. This makes more sense if the goal is to model how other people see UNL's departments, as people tend to remember outstanding work in the field more than they remember or consider average work.

### SRI Problem 2 - Cross-Department Comparisons

It is **completely inappropriate** to use SRI values to compare departments to other departments within the same university. 
SRI values have a distribution that is discipline specific, with different means and variances. 
As-is they are not comparable outside of that distribution, as shown in @tbl-sri-incomparable


```{r}
#| label: tbl-sri-incomparable
unl_depts |> filter(SRI==.4) |>
  select(Unit, SRI, `SRI Percentile`, `Number of Units`, `SRI Rank`) |>
  arrange(desc(`SRI Percentile`)) |>
  knitr::kable(caption="Departments at UNL with an SRI of 0.4 (calculated using all AcA universities), but with considerable variance in SRI percentile. Note that while the SRI values and percentiles would be different if the comparison population were limited to public AAU universities, the concept is still important. Changing or reducing the comparison population only changes how many universities are available for eCDF estimation and percentile calculation and shifts the population mean and variance to some degree.")
```

Calculating a mean and standard deviation to create a z-score for SRI values across disciplines destroys any information which could have been found in the SRI measure.

Note that this is *not* an objection to SRI as a concept. 
It seems that SRI is a more fair method of comparison than other attempts to replicate SRI used in this process, because at least all departments across a discipline are compared using the same (sometimes flawed) data^[Academic Analytics analysts are very aware of the flaws in their data. If UNL wants to improve as an institution, one way to facilitate that would be to have PIs to ask e.g. federal grant agencies other than NIH and NSF to report data to Academic Analytics, as this would likely help us.].
As it is, the metrics assembled by UNL, while applied to all departments equally, have unequal effects on different departments because the metrics used favor one discipline over another due to norms within that discipline.
The problem with SRI is that it must be used in the context for which it was intended: comparing departments to other similar departments. 

**Problem** Under the UNL proposed method (using the SRI relative to public AAU institutions), it seems that custom SRI is used instead of percentile. This renders any calculations done on SRI, and any calculations which use `sri_aau_public_peers` or `sri_aau_public_peers_z_score`, functionally meaningless as they are not comparing values drawn from the same distribution to each other. Without a common reference distribution, it is inappropriate to pool values by calculating a common mean and variance, and then to use that common mean and variance to produce a z-score. 

**Solution** SRI should be converted to a percentile (or corresponding quantile, if the goal is a z-score), and in disciplines without sufficient comparison departments, there will be a lot of variability in the percentile (which should be treated as an estimate). 

**Theory & Statistical Rationale**
The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem guarantees that as  $n\rightarrow\infty$ the empirical CDF (eCDF) converges to the distribution CDF [demonstration via WolframAlpha](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ConvergenceOfTheEmpiricalDistributionFunctionOfASample/). 
While there is no guideline for sufficient $n$, the eCDF will be extremely blocky and step-function like at first, and as $n$ increases, the average distance between discontinuity points will decrease, producing an increasingly smooth function. 
The variance of the estimated percentile can be estimated by treating the percentile as a proportion and using a [binomial confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval) to get a sense of the variability. Then, this binomial confidence interval can be mapped back to normal quantiles if a z-score range is desired.

## Awards


1.68 `awards_ltd_2023_total` NCR highly prestigious awards, including national academy memberships in engineering, medicine and science. The data source AAU uses for highly prestigious awards is Academic Analytics (AcA) and only awards for T/TT faculty in benchmarked AcA units is reported to the AAU. Highly prestigious awards are tracked over the life of the faculty member’s career and are credited to the institution where they are currently employed. Once a faculty member retires or leaves an institution, their highly prestigious awards are no longer included in the data reported to AAU. Put another way, the highly prestigious awards follow the faculty member.
From the AAU Membership Policy: AAU collects the number of faculty members by institution receiving awards, fellowships, and memberships in the National Research Council (NRC) list of highly prestigious awards that included: research/scholarship awards, teaching awards, prestigious fellowships or memberships in honorary societies. Each data year represents the faculty’s lifetime honors and awards, not new honors and awards. University of Maryland, College Park data includes University of Maryland, Baltimore beginning in 2019. The Faculty Scholarly Productivity (FSP) Database. These data are reproduced under a license agreement with Academic Analytics. http://academicanalytics.com/ . The list of the NRC highly prestigious awards can be found at: National Research Council List of Highly Prestigious Awards | Association of
American Universities (AAU). Memberships in the National Academies (NAS, NAE, NAM) compiled from the membership lists of each academy; lists can be found at: National Academy of Sciences: http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/, National Academy of Engineering: http://www.nae.edu/default.aspx?id=20412, National Academy of Medicine: https://nam.edu/directory-search-form/


::: callout

Award comparisons should be made within discipline, not across disciplines, as the AAU list of prestigious awards does not include the [AERA](https://www.aera.net/About-AERA/AERA-Awards) awards for education. 
As the national academies listed do not induct professors teaching in education, it is irrational to compare e.g. the physics department, whose members could conceivably be inducted into the NAS, NAE, or both depending on the subfield. 
This is one reason why Academic Analytics compares within discipline and not across disciplines.

# Instructional Z-scores in Institutional Metrics

All z-scores (also known as standardized or normalized scores) were calculated as the
difference of the actual metric and the mean of the metric for included units divided by the
standard deviation of the included units’ metrics. 

It measures the number of standard deviations a metric is from the mean. 
In a normal distribution, approximately two-thirds of scores fall within +/- 1 standard deviation of the mean. 
Approximately 95% of cases fall within +/- 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. 
Traditionally – but not universally – cases beyond the 1.96 standard deviation threshold are considered outliers.

::: callout
### Instructional Z-score Problem

While standardizing scores is common practice in some circumstances, it is problematic as used here, in part because it assumes that there is a single common distribution used for these values. 
For instance, disciplines that only have graduate programs cannot be assumed to have the same distribution of SCH because of much lower numbers of graduate students. 
It is utterly ridiculous to compare these programs to programs such as math or english who teach large numbers of nonmajor undergraduate service courses and will have SCH values on a vastly different scale. 
Departments **do not** have quantities which can be said to be "identically distributed" (in statistical parlance) even if you assume that the instructional metrics are reflective of a distribution of department performance, because not every department is competing in every pool.
At minimum, it would be necessary to do some assessment of whether a course is primarily taken by majors or nonmajors, and then compare service teaching load separately from major teaching load, and undergraduate hours separately from graduate hours. 
Even under this system, it is probably necessary to "bin" departments based on the number of service courses taught/required on an annual basis, because e.g. Math will teach Calc 1, 2, 3, but Chemistry might teach an elective introductory course that counts for a science prerequisite, and the structural differences between these two departments and their relationship to other majors offered on campus matter significantly. 
While these factors are related to department productivity, no amount of work by the EDAD department is going to ensure that they teach every undergraduate STEM major an introductory service course, and as such it is ridiculous to compare SCH between EDAD and MATH or PHYS or STAT. 

Moreover, the description of interpretation implies that these are normally distributed variables, but e.g. share of growth is necessarily confined to a value between 0 and 1, which is decidedly not normal because the normal distribution has support over the entire real line (that is, every value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$ has a positive, theoretically non-zero probability, though of course the values far from the mean of the distribution are expected to be infinitesimal). 

When a metric consists of a ratio of two values, as many of these metrics do, it is even less likely that the random quantity has a normal distribution. In fact, if the numerator and denominator are both standard normally distributed, the ratio is Cauchy distributed, and Cauchy variables do not have estimable means or variance -- you can calculate a value for observed data, but it does not mean anything and is not an estimator of any useful quantity. While the problem is not quite as dramatic when the means of both distributions are nonzero, it is still important to be cautious because there are a number of different [ratio distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_distribution) which might be relevant and not all of them are "nice". 
This might be expected to be the case with a variable like `budget_to_sch_2024`. 

Ultimately, just because you *can* calculate a z-value doesn't ensure that it has meaning in the context of the data. 
Even if it would *seem* to have meaning, and every point is taken from the same reference distribution, if the values are ratios, it would probably be good to check with a statistician before proceeding, because it is *very* easy to end up in a nonsensical mathematical situation.
